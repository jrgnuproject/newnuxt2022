## Setup
<h1>Website Visitors Can Be Tracked And Reported Using Google Analytics</h1>
<p>Analytics. <a href="https://www.seo25.com/how-to-track-website-traffic-using-google-analytics/">Google Analytics</a>: Google Analytics provides basic audience and behavior metrics. It can segment users' demographics, the devices they accessed your site with, and whether they have visited your site before. It can also track a website's advertising performance and overall traffic numbers.</p>
<h2>What is Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is a free analytics platform that is used by both individuals and businesses. It helps track websites performance and can be used for a wide range of analytics, ranging from local SEO, conversion tracking, website analytics, as well as email marketing. Analytics uses a combination of data points from a website, such as visits, pageviews, and conversion rates. For example, if a website has 1 million pageviews a month and 7% of visitors will convert, the analytics will categorize that website's users as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conversion user. This user visited your site, completed a sales transaction, and will come back.</li>
<li>Duplicate visitor. This user visited your site, completed a sale, and will never come back.</li>
<li>Average user.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What Is the Difference Between Visits And Visitors On Wordpress?</h3>
<p><a href="https://4okk5.app.link/instant-traffic">Buy Website Visitors</a>: Visitors on a WordPress site are logged on. This means that they are viewing your site but have not left a specific path (which you define) to other parts of your site. Website visits generally do not add to your traffic total unless you actively redirect them. Visitors usually are looking at a different area of your site, such as an informational page, advertising area or sales funnel, than the site visitors who have stayed on the site for more than five seconds.</p>
<p>Visit stats. The visitor information from a Wordpress website also is tracked using its advanced "visitor tools," which allow you to create reports on the number of visits to your site and the order of users' visits.</p>
